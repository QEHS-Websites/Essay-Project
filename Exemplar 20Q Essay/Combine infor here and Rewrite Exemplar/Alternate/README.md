Mr. Mercer's project for "Essay Project", meant for sand boxing, etc.

Steps
. Boilerplate automatically from Atom, Additions to Boilerplate
. Footer additions, including FOOTER
. Copy entire webpage text into HTML Layout (Introductory Boilerplate)
. ID difficult or important words
   - Manage the wrap around feature of Atom
   - Find an image, download the image into Images, link the word to the Image (opened in a "separate tab")
   - Navigation to New Tab
   - Use Google Image search to link to actual search URL (Google Search uses individual preferences so a reader would not see what I see, copying the Search URL helps this)
   - Pick some words to define that open in the same TAB so the text disappears and navigation is in the browser (this helps readers focus their attention)
. Dealing with images - see Becky's Video
