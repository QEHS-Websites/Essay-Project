    <h3>The Text</h3>
      <h2>Is it bigger than a breadbox?</h2> <h3>Yes.</h3>
      <p>I have always been tall,
        <strong>
        decidedly tall
        </strong>. Yet, my curiosity has always surpassed my height. <br>
        Starting at a young age, I would ask
        <strong> countless questions</strong>
        , from <em>How heavy is the Earth?</em>  <br>
        to <em>Where does rain come from?</em>
        My curiosity, displayed in questions like these, has truly defined <br>
         me as a person and as a student. Therefore, it is not surprising that I became
         <a href="https://www.google.ca/search?q=transfixed&oq=transfixed&aqs=chrome..69i57j0l5.3618j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8"
         target="_blank">
         transfixed</a> <br>
         the first time I played 20Q (the electronic version of
         <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twenty_Questions"
            target="_blank">
         Twenty Questions).</a> <br>
         Somehow, a
         <a href="http://images.mentalfloss.com/sites/default/files/20q_game_12.jpg?resize=1100x740"
               target="_blank">
         little spherical device</a> guessed what I was thinking. <br>
         The piece of technology sparked my curiosity and instilled in me a unique interest in 20Q. <br>
         This interest would later reveal valuable character traits of mine while also paralleling various facets of my life. <br>
      </P>

      <h2>Does it strive to learn?</h2> <h3>Yes.</h3>
        <p>
          I became determined to discover how 20Q guessed correctly. After some research, I discovered artificial intelligence, <br>
          more specifically, artificial neural networks systems which learn and improve themselves. <br>
          This idea fascinated me. I wanted to learn more. I read avidly, seeking and absorbing as much information as I could. <br>
          When given the opportunity years later, I signed up for the first computer programming class available to me. <br>
          I found myself in an environment I loved. I would stay after class, go in during free periods, make my own apps, <br>
          and work over Cloud-based IDEs. I prized the freedom and the possibilities. <br>
        </p>

      <h2>Is it driven?</h2> <h3>Yes.</h3>
        <p>
          After my introduction to 20Q, I began to play Twenty Questions (the traditional parlor game) <br>
          and became determined to rival the guessing accuracy of the artificial intelligence. At first I was mediocre. <br>
          However, through long car rides with family, good-natured yet heated competitions with friends, logical strategy, <br>
          and time, I became more effective. I discovered the secrets to success: practice and perseverance. <br>
        </p>

      <h2>Does it apply what it learns?</h2> <h3>Yes.</h3>
        <p>
          As 20Q implements what it learns, so do I. Throughout high school, I applied the secret of practice <br>
          to my basketball career. I spent countless hours sharpening my skills in 90-degree summer heat to 20-degree <br>
          late-winter cold, countless afternoons playing pickup games with my friends, <br>
          and countless weekends traveling to AAU basketball tournaments. As a result, <br>
          I became a starter for my school's varsity team. I applied another secret, this time the secret of perseverance, <br>
          by dedicating myself to physical therapy after knee surgery in order to quickly return to football. <br>
          Later that year, I became the first player in my grade to score a varsity touchdown. <br>
        </p>

      <h2>Does it attempt to better itself?</h2> <h3>Yes.</h3>
        <p>
          Once I became proficient at Twenty Questions, I strengthened my resolve to become masterful. To do so, <br>
          I needed to become a skillful inquisitor and to combine that with my analytical nature and interpersonal skills, <br>
          all of which are vital for success in Twenty Questions. Because I had been debating politics <br>
          with my friends since the 8th grade, I recognized that debate could sharpen these skills. <br>
          I began to debate more frequently (and later more effectively) in English and government class, <br>
          at the lunch table and family gatherings, and whenever the opportunity presented itself. <br>
          This spurred in me an interest for how public policy and government work, leading me to attend Boys State <br>
          and receive a nomination for The United States Senate Youth Program. <br>
        </p>

      <h2>Does it think deeply?</h2> <h3>Yes.</h3>
        <p>
          So far, I have realized that thriving at Twenty Questions, just like life, is all about tenacity, <br>
          rationality and interpersonal skills. I have found that, as in Twenty Questions, always succeeding is impossible; <br>
          however, by persevering through difficulties and obstacles, favorable outcomes are often attainable. <br>
          As I have become better at Twenty Questions, so too have I improved in many other aspects of my life. <br>
          Nonetheless, I realize that I still have unbounded room to grow. And much like 20Q, <br>
          I will continue to learn throughout my life and apply my knowledge to everything I do. <br>
        </p>

      <h2>Are you thinking of me?</h2> <h3>Yes.</h3>
