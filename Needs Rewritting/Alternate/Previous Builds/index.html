<div class="paragraph">
  I have always been tall, <b>decidedly tall</b>. Yet, my curiosity has always <b>surpassed my height</b>.
  Starting at a young age, I would ask countless questions, from "How heavy is the Earth? to
  "Where does rain come from?" My curiosity, displayed in questions like these,
  has truly defined me as a person and as a student. Therefore, it is not surprising
  that I became transfixed the first time I played <i>20Q</i> (the electronic version of <i>Twenty Questions</i>
  <sub><a href="http://images.mentalfloss.com/sites/default/files/20q_game_12.jpg?resize=1100x740"
    href="20q_game_12.jpg" target="_blank">Click Here for Game Image</a></sub>).
  Somehow, a little spherical device guessed what I was thinking. The piece of
  technology <b>sparked</b> my curiosity and instilled in me a unique interest in <i>20Q</i>.
  This interest would later reveal <i>valuable character traits</i> of mine while also paralleling various facets of my life.
</div>
<div class="section">Does it strive to <strong>learn</strong>?<br><em>Yes</em>.</div>
<div class="planning">
  <ul>
    <li>artificial intelligence

    <li>coding
  </ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
  I became determined to discover how <i>20Q guessed</i> correctly. After some research,
  I discovered <b>artificial intelligence</b>, more specifically, artificial <b>neural networks' systems</b>
  which learn and improve themselves. This idea fascinated me. I wanted to learn more. I read avidly,
  seeking and absorbing as much information as I could. When given the opportunity years later,
  I signed up for the first computer programming class available to me. I found myself in an
  environment I loved. I would stay after class, go in during free periods, make my own apps,
  and work over Cloud-based IDEs. <i>I prized the freedom and the possibilities</i>.
</div>
<div class="section">Is it <strong>driven</strong>?<br><em>Yes</em>.</div>
<div class="planning">
  <ul>
    <li>improving with practice and perservence
  </ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
  After my introduction to <i>20Q</i>, I began to play <i>Twenty Questions</i> (the traditional parlor game)
  and became determined to rival the guessing accuracy of the <b>artificial intelligence</b>. At first I was mediocre.
  However, through long car rides with family, good-natured yet heated competitions with friends,
  logical strategy, and time, I became more effective. I discovered the "secrets" to success: <b>practice and perseverance</b>.
</div>
<div class="section">Does it <strong>apply</strong> what it learns?<br><em>Yes</em>.</div>
<div class="planning">
  <ul>
    <li>examples of secrets
  </ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
  As <i>20Q</i> implements what it learns, so do I. Throughout high school, I applied the "secret"
  of <b>practice</b> to my basketball career. I spent countless hours sharpening my skills in 90-degree
  summer heat to 20-degree late-winter cold, countless afternoons playing pickup games with my friends,
  and countless weekends traveling to AAU basketball tournaments. As a result, I became a
  starter for my school's varsity team. I applied another "secret", this time the "secret" of <b>perseverance</b>,
  by dedicating myself to physical therapy after knee surgery in order to quickly return to football.
  Later that year, I became the first player in my grade to score a varsity touchdown.
</div>
<div class="section">Does it attempt to <strong>better</strong> itself?<br><em>Yes</em>.</div>
<div class="planning">
  <ul>
    <li>examples becoming masterful
  </ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
  Once I became proficient at <i>Twenty Questions</i>, I strengthened my resolve to become <b>masterful</b>.
  To do so, I needed to become a skillful inquisitor and to combine that with my analytical
  nature and interpersonal skills, all of which are vital for success in <i>Twenty Questions</i>.
  Because I had been debating politics with my friends since the 8th grade, I recognized
  that debate could sharpen these skills. I began to debate more frequently
  (and later more effectively) in English and government class, at the lunch table
  and family gatherings, and whenever the opportunity presented itself. This spurred in
  me an interest for how public policy and government work, leading me to attend Boys State
  and receive a nomination for The United States Senate Youth Program.
</div>
<div class="section">Does it <strong>think deeply</strong>?<br><em>Yes</em>.</div>
<div class="planning">
  <ul>
    <li>lifelong learning exampels
  </ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
  So far, I have realized that thriving at <i>Twenty Questions</i>, just like life, is all about <b>tenacity</b>,
  <b>rationality</b> and <b>interpersonal skills</b>. I have found that, as in Twenty Questions, always
  succeeding is impossible; however, by persevering through difficulties and obstacles,
  favorable outcomes are often attainable. As I have become better at Twenty Questions,
  so too have I improved in many other aspects of my life. Nonetheless, I realize that I
  still have unbounded room to grow. And much like <i>20Q</i>, I will continue to learn throughout
  my life and apply my knowledge to everything I do.

<div class="section">Are you thinking of me?<br><strong><em>Yes</strong></em>.</div>

  We were impressed by the unique format Ben chose to describe himself and the lessons learned
  through his interest in computer science. However, the essay's creative style succeeds due
  to the strength of its content. Ben simulates electronic 20 questions to hook the reader's
  attention while effectively bridging his academic interests and future aspirations. The
  essay showcases his versatile interests, from computer science to basketball to political
  debate, as concrete examples that demonstrate his personal philosophy of "practice and perseverance".
  The essay successfully tells us about Ben's personality, academic and social interests,
  and future ambitions, showing us a competitive student who would thrive here.
